        Milton Hershey had a clear idea of what he wanted when, on Nov. 15,
        1909, he and his wife, Catherine, signed the 26-page legal document that
        would be the basis of their charity. The deed reflected the
        idiosyncratic wishes of its founders: to create the Hershey Industrial
        School, controlled by Milton Hershey’s bank and located on Hershey-owned
        farms in Derry Township, south of Harrisburg, where orphans would milk
        cows and cut hay. Only “poor, healthy white male orphans, of … ages
        between four and eight years” would be admitted.

        “[T]he main object in view,” the Hersheys wrote in the deed, “is to
        train young men to useful trades and occupations” so that once a student
        left the school, “he may be able to support himself.”

            By the late 1930s, that number had grown to around 1,000. But by

            In the 1990s, the school moved away from the farm programs and
            trade-school shops that Milton Hershey had envisioned as the pathway
            out of poverty and upgraded its academics.

            A system was introduced starting with the class of 2011, which
            students who start college but don’t finish must pay back the loans
            on their own.
