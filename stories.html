          With more than $17 billion in assets, the Milton Hershey School is
          richer than Penn State and the University of Pittsburgh combined. The
          boarding school educates and houses about 2,100 low-income and at-risk
          children, pre-K through high school. In recent years, half have come
          from families with histories of substance abuse, around 40% had a
          family history of mental health problems, and about a third had a
          family member who was incarcerated. According to its tax records, MHS
          spent $91,095 per child on academics, sports, trips, mental and
          physical health care, scholarships and living expenses in the 2018-19
          academic year — intended as a glide path to the middle class.

          Of the four behavioral rankings at the time — “Novice,” “Brown,”
          “Gold” and “Spartan,” the highest — he was repeatedly ranked as
          “Novice,” the lowest. Falling behind in school, he’d often stay up
          late to study, then oversleep the next day. He also remembers
          receiving demerit points for breaking a door and cursing at one of his
          houseparents. By graduation, Bost said he was eligible for only
          $15,000 of the $79,000 in total scholarship money that was available
          to each student in the class of 2011. The school declined to comment
          on Bost’s account. Now living in Hazleton, Bost works for DoorDash and
          wonders how things might have gone if he hadn’t lost so much of the
          scholarship — would he have landed a better job, perhaps, or be
          running his own business.

          Jordan said she didn’t worry about being in debt; she says she thought
          the school would pay off all her loans if she graduated on time. At
          Wilkes, however, Jordan soon began to feel that she didn’t fit
          in.Jordan said her grades were good, but she became depressed. She
          withdrew after three semesters, intending to go back, and returned
          home with $17,500 in debt. Almost nine years later, she has defaulted
          on the loans and her credit score is too low for her to rent her own
          apartment. She said she still doesn’t fully understand the details of
          the financial aid package she signed at age 18.

          At MHS, she had never skipped classes. But now, there was no one to
          make sure she didn’t sleep through her 8 a.m. Spanish class. Nothing
          seemed to make sense in physics, so she stopped going altogether. And
          when her grades started slipping, she didn’t lose privileges or have
          to do extra chores until she got them back up. In her first semester,
          Eny-Edy earned a GPA below 1.0 and her MHS scholarship was suspended.

          By early 2017, older and wiser and ready to give college another try,
          she sent a Facebook message to her seventh grade English teacher at
          MHS, Tanya Baynham, asking if her scholarship could be reinstated.
          Baynham — who was by then overseeing the scholarship program — said
          there was nothing she could do, Eny-Edy recalled. According to another
          school rule, students in her class had five years to use the money.
          Eny-Edy was a year too late. “I had worked for 14 years to earn this
          scholarship, and I finally got to the mountaintop and I failed,” she
          said.
