        With more than $17 billion in assets, the Milton Hershey School is
        richer than Penn State and the University of Pittsburgh combined. The
        boarding school educates and houses about 2,100 low-income and at-risk
        children, pre-K through high school. In recent years, half have come
        from families with histories of substance abuse, around 40% had a family
        history of mental health problems, and about a third had a family member
        who was incarcerated. According to its tax records, MHS spent $91,095
        per child on academics, sports, trips, mental and physical health care,
        scholarships and living expenses in the 2018-19 academic year — intended
        as a glide path to the middle class.

            The school is unlike almost any other in the U.S. It accepts no
            government aid and charges no tuition or fees. Nearly $180 million
            in stock dividends flows, tax-free, into the school’s coffers each
            year, derived from the high-margin profits from chocolate, candies
            and snacks made by the huge, for-profit Hershey Co.

            Students live in group homes of eight to 12, cared for by MHS staff
            known as “houseparents,” who, under school rules, must be married
            couples. Among their responsibilities: to monitor and rate student
            behavior as the front-line enforcers of the school’s disciplinary
            program, a tiered system of merits and demerits.

            In their MHS homes, alums said they were ranked by how well they did
            their chores and followed rules. Among the behaviors that graduates
            told us affected their ranking: gossiping, being late, not eating
            all their dinner, having a bad attitude and failing to vacuum and
            dust properly. A higher ranking would lead to more privileges, like
            being able to watch TV or having a later bedtime.

          What are the tiers of infractions that would lead to demerits?

            Accumulating enough demerits can cost a student thousands of dollars
            of their scholarship. According to the 2019-20 student handbook, for
            instance, a student who accrues more than 50 demerit points in a
            year risks earning less than the full scholarship amount for that
            year. More serious misbehavior could lead to a student losing the
            entire scholarship they would have earned that year.

        The Philadelphia Inquirer, Spotlight PA and ProPublica set out to
        understand how well MHS is fulfilling its mission, laid out by chocolate
        company entrepreneur Milton S. Hershey and his wife, Catherine, when
        they founded the school 111 years ago. Reporters analyzed Hershey
        financial records; reviewed court documents; talked to state officials,
        education experts and child care providers; and interviewed more than 50
        former students who graduated between 1940 and 2020 about the school’s
        impact on their lives.
